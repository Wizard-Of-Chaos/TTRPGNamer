A name generator written so I don't have to think up names on the fly while running tabletop games.

This was written several years ago as an aid to myself so I didn't have to think up names on the fly while DMing, since that's one of my pitfalls as a DM.
The text files are fully editable; adding your own descriptors or names will function right.

I reinvented the wheel with the array_list files; that was done so I could re-familiarize myself with the base mechanics of how that works.
Compile it, run it, will pull up a command-line window.
